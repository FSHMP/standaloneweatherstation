## Community Creation

Along with the initiators of Weather Station project, everyone of like minded individual networked with the community, have inspired by the effort - for not just only about weather station itself but also a collaborative approach that have first seeded a really useful hardware based project returning the DIY ethos and enthusiasm. It has given fun for the people who have done it. The initial members of the project has more to share about what they have learned, and we also need to accept that with a small group we have tried to the extend which we can economically afford to do. Every community projects that starts with fun, really tend to continue with fun. 

On that basis, either through the group effort or through opportunistic encouragement that comes from external forces, enables us to move further. This is also the time that the group rearranges itself democratically to allow new contributors to help add new responsible features that help flow the innovation. 

## What is so special about Weather Station Instrumentation ?

Every hardware project is special, and really such project encompasses some degree of software in it nowadays. Even in good old mechanical days, the mathematics formed the soft core of the project which is not physical. In our case, with collaborative encouragement and contribution - we know that making a **Self sufficient + Networked + Weather Station** inherently has a cool hyper-interdisciplinary approach for integrating the instrument together. Making it collaboratively and deploying it in apt places - might be our house roofs, or farm lands - gives a psychedelic satisfaction. :)

With such interdisciplinary approach, we need to constrain the project with boundaries based on economic requirement, availability; and to balance it with necessary accuracy in measurement. A weather station is highly modular, yet at the same time is integrated together physically (mechanical, electronic, electromagnetic) necessitating community with wide set of skills and interests to learn and do. It is just similar to building a robot, but simply lean and mean so that it can survive ruggedly in harsh conditions too. It has a longhaul operation by nature of requirment. Furthermore, what is so so cool when it is engineered with **Free Hardware + Free Software Tools, Skills, Licenses, Research, Open Data, Open Design** ?

> The effectiveness of such construction is already proved by the humble project initiators & will continue to participate along with new contributors.

Ever heared about **1 meter 1 billion**, the common problem for all individuals of humanity facing the reality of climate crisis. Whatever may be the cause of the scenario, we have learned that we have to necessarily tackle the situation in hand, but adapting better to the space ship Earth. Better adapting comes from better understanding. Better understanding comes from critical interpretation. Critical interpreatation founts from proper observation skills and tools. Such tools, when contributed and made by commons, it becomes a platform that is so powerful than any other platform ever created by any corporates or governments or even combined.

Ofcourse, we cannot do everything about weather stuff we dream about, in reality. Atleast those who could afford time, and some resource can do great. With rising community participation in wider socio-economic issues, active scientific participation becomes vital and proving the progressive nature of the commons platform as a side effect of the effort.

## Organizing:

It is very similar to any other instrumentation project that encompasses several parts to it. Each of them has to be handled with their own design perspective and need to be implemented with their engineering principles. Thus it requires a interesting integration approach for erecting a weather station. The following are the microgroups that can be formed for realizing a complete weather station. The microgroups can vary in size from single contributor to few contributors right enough to manage the task and goal in hand. Too much people might cause confusion.

### Mechanical Design group: 

Has to learn from existing weather stations, and study its mechanical structure, else can build mechanical systems required from scratch. In both cases, it would be good to have a CAD Design for the project, that not only helps us stabilizing with mental image of how the result is going to be, but also in future easily edit the design as per specific requirements. Furthermore, we can able to share the design with appropriate licenses to other individuals and communities with similar goals and motives. It also pushes us to learn mechanical CAD tools, principles, techniques while contributors with specific skill set is not available.

Mechanical design provides the framework for the instrument. Thus it needs to address the mechanical stability, ruggedness, strength, mass, modularity, portability, support structure. Depending upon the later instrumentation requirments, design might be updated often to suit for the placement of components that help measure the weather parameters. The goal is to keep it simple enough to use, and simple enough to develop. Here again those who are interested can go on to complex things associated with the design like simulating the response of the mechanical design using computational fluid dynamics and testing using multiphysics environment - ofcourse using Free software tools and environments. Do not understimate the effectiveness of doing such thing. It is actually interesting to do science with computational help - and lot of knowledge can be learned even when it is not helpful at initial stages of development.
