# Self Sufficient Weather Station

> I humbly request initial contributors and admin of the repo, to edit this file - only for better organization. Always the credits goes to the humble beginners.

**A standalone weather station Project done by FSHM and PSF Pondicherry.**

The project uses Arduinno Mega at its Heart &lt;3. 

Still this version of the weather station is functioning and logs the data openly. The project is also shared through Instructables, and discussed to good extend among local people through online discussion forums. Several recommendations and advises are noted and to be implemented.
