## Meteorology

To quench our thirst to understand Nature at different scales, with different view points - meterology serves to be a excellent candidate. Through out the history of human kind, we have always interpreted our environment in various forms. Our interpreation can be best understood with various manifestations of research activities we engage in this era.

Among many other similar research fields - that has significant influence on day to day activities from individual citizens to global economic instruments, meteorology encompasses several disciplines of studies, experiments, scientific temper, participation from renowned experts to amateur individuals with ethos of sharing knowledge, learning, experimenting, interpreting measurement made and volunteer for the collective contribution.

## Common's Science

Just like any other scientific discipline, Meteorology requires huge participation, in a scale where any number of participation available will be helpful in collaboration and cooperation. We have adopted a degree of euphemism and stylishness with time for such **scientific participation**, ranging from amateur hobbyists, to citizen scientists. With the availability of commons infrastructures like **Internet**, **Free software tools**, & scientific temper, we have come up with several ways of organizing ourselves to effectively contribute what we wish to offer for a particular study or experimentation. 

We have participated more in science, engineering, technology, more actively than in any other field and have made our explorations more entycing than ever. The contribution ranges from Wikipedia, to BOINC computation resource contribution; from making hobby electronics to weather instruments; from technological projects to amateur satellites; from radiosondes to sounding rockets; etc..

Science is becoming more and more a commons platform, with rapid innovation in tools and technologies that the previous generation has explored, concieved as prototypes and imaginations. Science has not only become accessible and available but also becoming more and more affordable. However the relative conception is still debatable with proper understanding of geo-political economics.

## What do Meteorologists' do ?

Take a look at this WMO(World Meteorological Organization) video.

Basically, to know everything about climate: 

1. observe & measure it through weather conditions at various scales and places, 
2. processing the observed data, 
3. building weather forecast models (research - theoretical and experimentation)
4. stream it to computationally intensive weather forecast models, 
5. publish result of forecasts publicly under public domain,
6. monitor and manage disaster events, intensive climatic events at different scales, 
7. broadcast information through different media
8. establish standards for instrumentation, data, protocols, computation, communication, etc..

Most of the stuff deals with Weather. 

### So what is Weather ?

Weather is what we observe, measure, quantify, interpret, process, predict, report. It is just a plain observation which we like to know about climatic system of planet Earth. Climatic dynamics of Earth is so much complex, such that everything is connected to everything else. It encompasses the biodiversity. One distant action eventually disrupts another entity through the complex network. Understanding it through one go is insanely hard, and thus naturally the operations are distributed and shared globally and locally in a decentralized manner.

Every continent, ocean, atmosphere have deep connections geographically. Thus due to historical, political reasons and sometimes with scientific reasons, many countries have their own domestic weather service and research institutions, which would then contribute to global weather forecasting. Most of the times such daunting and financially burden task are handled by repsecitve governments.

However, with increased commons participation - effectively the elitist playground - where governments and huge corporates playing in the field are becoming more and more accessible day by day. But with more access and availability, understanding the weather systems becomes much vital and significant from individual, to communities, to societies, to non-profit organizations for a proper scientific contribution and service.

## Broad categories of Weather Observation

Weather observation starts with 5 broad category based on the scale which in turn refers to geographical access. Observation begins with instruments that are grouped to form a **Weather Station**. The following is a generic categorization:

1. Weather Stations (GROUND/SURFACE OBSERVATION)
 Personal Weather Stations
 Amateur/Corporate Weather Stations
 Government Weather Stations
2. Airborne Stations (AVIATION OBSERVATION)
3. Weather Balloons (UPPER AIR OBSERVATION)
 Uses Helium Balloons
 Uses Radiosondes
4. Weather Satellite (GLOBAL OBSERVATION)
 Uses sophisticated instruments
5. Weather Radar
 Uses Doppler Radar

Observed datas from all of these several stations distributed and networked around the globe are collected, processed and fused together using computational systems to help forecast the weather with proper update intervals.
