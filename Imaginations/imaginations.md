## Let the imaginations flow

Let us not restrict our design ideas for engineering/technological feasibility. We shall decouple, when such situation occurs. Always it is the design that brings new requirements - which initiates new projects that are not previously avaialble in public domain projects. For practicality, we shall organize ourselves to decouple the tightness between design and engineering practice, and couple it when required.

Thus in such scope, all who are interested in immediate crafting, designing, drawing their imagination (remember every imagination is a possibility) in a **paper-pencil-eraser** (the bigger the better) can please share the scanned or imaged copy into the paper-pencil-eraser directory.

Those who have further refined the paper design and ported it into computer aided design environment, can also share the same in the **computer-aided** directory. People are already familiar in directly drawing in the CAD environment founting directly from their brains can also use it to share their imaginations.

## This is very important

All of us in such a collaborative project - that possibly have really wide influence than we can ever think of - if only rightly forged at phases, need to have a constant self-encouragement. Such encouragement comes from when we share the design ideas, imaginations, and immediately see the feedback in the Paper form or in CAD form is very very remarkably important. No matter how shitty it is, the feedback criticizes us. It is the adversary that sculptes the designer, engineer, doer, hacker, maker, researcher, within us. Without this feedback, we shall lose hope and encouragement while implementing the project.

Having a imagination, drawing it down, feeding back on it, and reimagining on it will let us work productively by doing everything that we can towards that particular design that evolves out of indidivuals imagination and collaborative adversary. This will start out as individuals contribution, but in the run will turn out to create a good enough design outcome - which we call be feeding upon.

> So do please share whatever the design you compose. Lets chew it, digest it and see if it smells bad or good. :D
